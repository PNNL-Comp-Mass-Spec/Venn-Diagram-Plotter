VIPER (Visual Inspection of Peak/Elution Relationships) can be used to visualize and characterize the features detected during LC-MS analyses.

### Description
This program can draw correctly proportioned and positioned Venn diagrams, supporting both two-circle and three-circle Venn diagrams (though the overlap regions of three-circle Venn diagrams are not always to scale). A Venn diagram (aka Euler diagram) is a method of visualizing the amount of overlap between two (or three) lists of data, using circles to signify the size of each circle and positioning the circles such that the area of overlap represents the amount of list overlap.

The program includes a graphical user interface (GUI) where the user enters sizes and amount of overlap between the two (or three) lists (the overlap must be determined separately by the user). The resultant Venn diagrams are displayed, the colors can be customized, and the diagrams can be copied to the clipboard or saved to disk.

##### Externally Developed Software
Luana Micallef has developed an improved 3-circle Venn diagram program that uses ellipses instead of circles, leading to more accurate representations of area-proportional overlap. For more information, see the [eulerAPE website](http://www.eulerdiagrams.org/eulerAPE/) at [http://www.eulerdiagrams.org/eulerAPE/](http://www.eulerdiagrams.org/eulerAPE/)
