Venn Diagram Plotter Change Log

Version 1.3.3250; November 24, 2008
	- Fixed a button positioning bug that occurs at certain screen resolutions when 3-circle overlap mode is enabled

Version 1.3.3103; June 30, 2008
	- Fixed coloring bug that failed to color the ABC overlap when Circle B overlapped entirely with Circle A
		- There is still some odd plotting behavior when the overlap between two circles becomes <10% of the total circle count
		- In these cases, your only option is to uncheck "Use fill color", then copy to the clipboard paste into a painting program 
          (e.g. Paint Shop Pro, Photoshop, or Windows Paint) and use the Fill command (aka the paint bucket) to manually color the regions

	- Added the option of specifying the overlap sizes rather than the total circle sizes
