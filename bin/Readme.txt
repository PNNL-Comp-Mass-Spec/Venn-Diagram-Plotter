Venn Diagram Plotter

This program will draw correctly proportioned and positioned Venn diagrams.  A 
Venn diagram is a method of visualizing the amount of overlap between two lists 
of data, using circles to signify the size of each circle and positioning the 
circles such that the area of overlap represents the amount of list overlap.  
The program includes a graphical user interface (GUI) where the user enters 
sizes and amount of overlap between the two lists (the overlap must be 
determined separately by the user).  The resultant Venn diagrams are displayed, 
the colors can be customized, and the diagrams copied to the clipboard or 
saved to disk.

Double click the VennDiagramPlotter_Installer.msi file to install.  The program
shortcut can be found at Start Menu -> Programs -> PAST Toolkit -> Venn Diagram Plotter
