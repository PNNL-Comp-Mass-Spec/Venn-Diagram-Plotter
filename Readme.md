This program draws correctly proportioned and positioned Venn diagrams,
supporting both 2-circle and 3-circle Venn diagrams (though the overlap regions
of 3-circle Venn diagrams are not always to scale).  A Venn diagram is a method 
of visualizing the amount of overlap between two (or three) lists of data, using 
circles to signify the size of each circle and positioning the circles such that the 
area of overlap represents the amount of list overlap.

## Features

The program includes a graphical user interface (GUI) where the user enters 
sizes and amount of overlap between the two (or three) lists (the overlap must be 
determined separately by the user).  The resultant Venn diagrams are displayed, 
the colors can be customized, and the diagrams can be copied to the clipboard or 
saved to disk.
